# Starry Sky Creation: Working with Unity3D Particle Effect System

## Links and Tutorials

A simple Google search will probably lead you to a tutorial by Thomas Kole from 2017, but it is now out of date. However, it is still of good starting value. <a href="https://thomaskole.wordpress.com/portfolio/how-to-generate-a-physically-accurate-star-field-in-unity-using-real-world-data/">Link</a>.

A more in depth search with the word "skybox" will lead you to a YouTube video by Mike Dolan Games, this is clearly based on Thomas Kole, without the real star data. Early version of the Starry Sky is based on this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-RAJ_7HTE">Link</a>.

## Particle Effect

To initiate a Particle Effect object in Unity Editor:

GameObject->Effect->Particle System

## Method of Simulation



## Scripts

1. <a href="Solar-System-Simulation/Assets/Scripts/MatchCameraRotation.cs">MatchCameraRotation</a> is a script to match the rotation of a camera to a target. It does not match any other degree of movement.

2. ~~<a href="Solar-System-Simulation/Assets/Scripts/StarParticleSystem.cs">StarParticleSystem</a> is a script to parse through modified HYG data and generate particles accordingly.~~
